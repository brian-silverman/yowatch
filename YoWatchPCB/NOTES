            - Paste mask shrink: 0 mils
        - Export all
            - Be sure to be in the gerbers directory when saving
            - Use default file names
            - Must confirm each file, and will need to confirm overwrite if file exists
    - File->Export->NC/Drill...
        - Export all
            - "One or several tools have not been specified...?".  Choose yes.
            - Be sure to be in the gerbers directory when saving
            - Use default file names
            - Must confirm each file, and will need to confirm overwrite if file exists
    - From command line, run:
      sh gerbers/diptrace2oshpark.sh 
          which (changes file names as follows (recommended by oshpark) and
          creates zip file yowatch.zip):
            yowatch.G2L
            yowatch.G3L
            yowatch.GBL
            yowatch.GBO

            yowatch.GTS
            yowatch.XLN

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:

There are no special requirements for populating/soldering the board - hot-air
rework, hotplate or oven, and hand soldering can all be used and/or combined.
However, because many of the parts are fine pitch, DIY soldering of the board
all at once can be error prone and difficult to debug.  The following
procedures help alleviate that issue by suggesting a step by step approach.
After soldering parts, the POST (Power On Self Test) will test if the parts
have been soldered on properly.  

- The following parts have SMD pads under the package that require hot-air
  rework, hotplate or oven soldering.  It may be easiest to do them together in
  one pass, as it is difficult to apply solder paste via the stencil when there
  are already parts on the board.
    - U1 - 3.3V regulator
    - U2 - PSoC
    - U4 - I2S microphone
    - U5 - Accelerometer (future)
    - Y1 - 24MHz
    - Y2 - 32kHz
- Optional parts that MAY be easier to populate with the above parts (YMMV):
    - J5 - OLED FFC cable connector
- Program PSoC via Cypress MiniProg3:
    - Attach J7 right angle five pin header 
    - Attach J3 UART pigtails
    - (Optional) Attach J6 Power pigtails
    - Attach 3.3V power to J6 (or can be clipped to VTARG/GND on J7 programmer
      header).  REQUIRED FOR PROGRAMMING!
    - With PSoC populated, test program download.  Download does appear to work
      reliably without any caps or crystals.  Program does require crystals to
      boot (true?).  May not boot without caps if programmer cable is not
      connected.
    - Populate crystals (if not already done above) and verify programming.
    - Reset board by shorting XRES to GND on J7 programming cable.
    - POST should run and display on UART at 115200.  Most tests should fail.
    - Add PSoC bypass caps, and 32kHz crystal's caps (optional)
    - POST should run and display on UART without programmer connected.
- Populate I2S microphone  and cap (if not already done above) and verify via
  POST
- Populate Accelerometer and components (if not already done above) and verify
  via POST
- 3.3V regulator test:
    - Populate:
        - U1 3.3V reg (if not already done above)
        - R1/6, C1/2/3
        - J4 (batt conn)
    - Supply 2.5 to 4.2V via batt conn.
    - Verify 3.3V out
- Populate U3 RAM and verify via POST
- (Optional) Populate U8 RAM and verify via POST
- OLED display:
    - Populate U7 12V reg and external components - manually verify 12V
    - Populate OLED display connector and external components
    - Connect OLED display
    - Verify POST on display
- Vib:
    - Populate vib connector and components
    - Verify vib during POST
- Other
    - Populate Buttons, and verify via debug
    - Verify BLE via Android YoPhone app
    - Verify current via R6
    - Battery:
        - Populate battery and charging connectors
        - Verify running on battery
            - POST should display valid battery voltage
            - Verify battery charging properly
    

TODO:
    - MCP1661 - review for PCB routing recommendations (Cin/out directly next to in/out pins,
      recommended trace width, etc)
