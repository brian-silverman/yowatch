Gerber export notes:

- Before export, verify:
    - PSoC (U2) ground pad:
        - Custom paste mask shrink: 40 mils
    - Y1 XTAL:
        - Custom paste mask shrink: 2 mils
    - BLE Antenna, all pads:
        - Disable all paste/mask
- Diptrace export for oshpark:
    - http://cryoarchive.net/tutorials/diptrace-tutorials/diptrace-design-your-pcb-for-oshpark-com/ 
    - Setup design rules as suggested
    - File->Export->Gerber...
        - Before export, settings should be:
            - Solder mask swell: 2 mils
            - Paste mask shrink: 0 mils
        - Export all
            - Be sure to be in the gerbers directory when saving
            - Use default file names
            - Must confirm each file, and will need to confirm overwrite if file exists
    - File->Export->NC/Drill...
        - Export all
            - "One or several tools have not been specified...?".  Choose yes.
            - Be sure to be in the gerbers directory when saving
            - Use default file names
            - Must confirm each file, and will need to confirm overwrite if file exists
    - From command line, run:
      sh gerbers/diptrace2oshpark.sh 
          which (changes file names as follows (recommended by oshpark) and
          creates zip file yowatch.zip):
            yowatch.G2L
            yowatch.G3L
            yowatch.GBL
            yowatch.GBO
            yowatch.GBS
            yowatch.GKO
            yowatch.GTL
            yowatch.GTO
            yowatch.GTS
            yowatch.XLN
    - For PCB via oshpark.com, upload yowatch.zip
    - For stencil via oshstencils.com, upload TopPaste.gbr


TODO:
    - MCP1661 - review for PCB routing recommendations (Cin/out directly next to in/out pins,
      recommended trace width, etc)
    - Change 50ohm resistors to 0603
    - Connectorize programming connector: use small pitch connector, and move
      up under battery.  It could pssibly even stay connectorised while in the
      case, if attached with a pigtail and laid flat.  Also, programming
      connector could be shifted slightly to lower right corner
    - Add notch to bottom, to make it easier to insert board into case
